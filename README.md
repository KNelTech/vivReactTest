# My React App

This is a React application I developed, following a set of specified directives. The application successfully meets all outlined requirements.

## Directives:

- Create a React component called `ItemList`.
- Fetch data from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) endpoint.
- Display the list of items in an unordered list (`<ul>`).
- Each item in the list should display its `userId` and `title`.
- Handle loading and error states appropriately.
- Add a click event to each item to display the `body` of the selected item at the top of the page.
